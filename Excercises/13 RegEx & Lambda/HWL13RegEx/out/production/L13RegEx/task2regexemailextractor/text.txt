LATEST 2015 EMAILS:----------------------
Today I found a mail list in Facebook. It's interesting. Robin uses e-mail account in mail.com: robinb@mail.com. Mike,
who is keen on many things: mkeenan@mail.com. Literature lovers' group: litplusgroup@gmail.com. You can find an e-mail
of a media there as well - media@mail.com, as well as lomg and strange IDs like waleedabdulgafoor@mail.com. But you can
find very short ones inc@mail.com. Some users use too many dots, for example nksn.k.soni@mail.com and others use mostly
initials: sdhmoy@gmail.com. And finally some people just merge their name and surname: kinomorsa@mail.com, to create a
username.
